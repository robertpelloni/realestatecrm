# CHANGELOG.md

## [0.36.0] - Hosted Vector Provider Finalization

- Added a provider switch for Pinecone or custom vector sync endpoints, with Pinecone auto-detection via environment variables.
- Kept the deterministic local embedding/vector-index fallback so the CRM still works without hosted infrastructure.

- Created a local vector index/outbox sync pipeline for activity, contact, lead, and deal records.
- Switched AI chat context from keyword-only summaries to semantic retrieval from workspace-scoped vector matches.
- Wired lead, contact, deal, and activity writes to sync into the vector store automatically.
- Documented the new RAG/vector env vars and ignored local vector index artifacts in git.

- Implemented `middleware.ts` to protect dashboard routes with NextAuth.
- Updated `(dashboard)/layout.tsx` to display logged-in user data from NextAuth session.

## [0.13.0] - Database Authentication Flow

- Updated all Server Actions to parse and return validation errors gracefully.
- Refactored `AddLeadModal`, `AddDealModal`, `AddContactModal`, and `AddTaskModal` to capture and display these validation errors without crashing the UI.
- Wired up the main `Dashboard` view to query Prisma dynamically, calculating active leads, pipeline values, and pending tasks based on actual data rather than mocks.

## [0.18.0] - UI Polish & Toast Notifications

- Added `react-hot-toast` to provide user feedback upon form submissions.
- Wrapped `Providers` with the `<Toaster />` context styled for the luxury theme.

## [0.19.0] - Activity Scaffolding & Dynamic List Filtering

- Added URL-based search (`q`) and `status` filtering to the Leads, Contacts, and Tasks list pages, fully satisfying strict Next.js 15 `useSearchParams` patterns.
- Scaffolded the `Activity` data model in Prisma. This lays the groundwork for the core CRM activity timeline (logging when lead states change, notes, emails, calls).

- Built the `AddActivityForm` component, allowing users to log notes on a Lead record.
- Added `activitySchema` in Zod to validate activity additions.
- Wired the `/leads/[id]` detail view to render the timeline dynamically using the newly scaffolded `Activity` model in Prisma.

## [0.21.0] - Upstream Workflow Synchronization

- Executed strict recursive merge of `origin/main` upstream features (Offer Draft and Listing Entry workflows) with local `main` branch.
- Successfully resolved all TypeScript collisions resulting from workflow scaffolding overlapping with core CRM `useSearchParams` filtering.
- Prevented schema divergence related to `Task` due dates to guarantee build stability alongside upstream UI additions.
- Verified stable production compile.

## [0.22.0] - Task Assignments, Due Dates, and Lead Pagination

- Safely solved ambiguous relation schema collisions by using named relations (`@relation("TaskAssignee")`) for `Task.assignedTo`.
- Updated `Task` Prisma model and Zod schemas to support `dueDate` and `assignedToId`.
- Updated `AddTaskModal` UI and the backend Server Action to capture, validate, and store Task deadlines and assignments.
- Implemented `take`/`skip` server-side pagination on the Leads list view using Next.js `searchParams`.

## [0.23.0] - Universal Pagination & Activity Propagation

- Extended the `take`/`skip` server-side pagination model uniformly across the `Contacts` and `Tasks` list pages to match `Leads`.
- Expanded the polymorphic `AddActivityForm` to `Deals` and `Contacts` detail views, ensuring unified timeline tracking across the entire CRM stack.
- Completed architectural analysis of the upstream `WorkflowStudio` components, generating `WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md` to map out upcoming DB integration phases.

## [0.24.0] - Workflow Schema Wiring & Dashboard Deep Linking

- Scaffolded `WorkflowSession` model in Prisma to track user workflow drafts (e.g. `OFFER_DRAFT`, `LISTING_ENTRY`).
- Removed local-storage mock handlers in upstream `WorkflowStudio` components.
- Introduced `src/lib/actions/workflow.ts` (Next.js Server Actions) to save and submit JSON workflow payloads directly to the SQLite backend.
- Converted aggregate dashboard metrics into deep-links (e.g., clicking "Tasks Due" pushes the user to `/tasks?status=TODO`).

## [0.25.0] - Phase 2 Workflow DB Hookups

- Built `src/lib/validations/workflow.ts` schema to enforce strict checking of workflow JSON payloads.
- Converted `/workflows/offer-draft` and `/workflows/listing-entry` to dynamic Server Components that parse `?sessionId` from the URL.
- These workflow pages now fetch existing `WorkflowSession` records from Prisma and inject their parsed JSON histories into `WorkflowStudio` components.
- The `WorkflowStudio` interactive shell is now a true persistent interface connected to the SQLite backend.

## [0.26.0] - Phase 2 Portal Scaffolding & Deal Workflows

- Integrated `WorkflowSession` routing deeply into the Deal Details view. Users can now spin up active Offer Drafts and Listing Entries directly associated to a specific CRM `Deal`.
- Created the foundational `(portal)` route group, establishing the client-facing UI shell (separate from the agent dashboard) where clients will eventually sign and review synced workflows.

## [0.27.0] - Portal Auth Routing & Handoff Preparation

- Reconfigured `next-auth` JWT callbacks (`src/lib/auth.ts`) to inject Prisma user roles and IDs directly into the session token.
- Applied `src/proxy.ts` middleware matcher to automatically protect the new `/(portal)` route group.
- Implemented data-driven views on `/portal` mapping the logged-in user's email directly to a `Contact` record, fetching their specific active `Deals` and pending `WorkflowSessions`.
- Reconciled tracking documentation for handoff to Phase 3 agents.

## [0.28.0] - Phase 3 AI Foundations

- Introduced the global floating `AIChat.tsx` interface on all `/(dashboard)` layouts, serving as the primary interactive surface for the upcoming AI assistant.
- Formulated and documented the `AI_RAG_STRATEGY.md` which establishes the architectural blueprint for syncing Prisma entities (`Lead`, `Activity`) with an external Vector Database.

## [0.29.0] - AI Assistant Backend Integration

- Installed `@ai-sdk/openai` and `ai` libraries to handle high-performance text streaming.
- Created `/api/chat` route to act as the primary Next.js Edge proxy for OpenAI LLM interactions, injecting strict brand and workflow context into the system prompt.
- Hand-rolled a custom streaming fetch implementation inside `AIChat.tsx` to handle streaming responses seamlessly within the UI without introducing external UI library module resolution conflicts.

## [0.30.0] - Repository Cleanup & Organization

- Reorganized project root to heavily reduce clutter.
- Consolidated all agent-specific prompting instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `GPT.md`, etc.) into `docs/agents/`.
- Moved historical planning docs and initial prompts to `docs/archive/` (`WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `GEMINI_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`).
- Refined `README.md` to link directly to the new structural locations.

## [0.31.0] - AI SDK Typing Stabilization & Environment Recovery

- Safely navigated node environment block and preserved architectural changes.
- Conducted experimental integration of `ai` SDK tools for Prisma DB context extraction.
- Reverted experimental tool logic due to breaking TypeScript API changes between `ai@3.1.x` and `toTextStreamResponse()` requirements, guaranteeing project build stability.

## [0.32.0] - Client Portal Magic Links (Phase 2 completion)

- Migrated NextAuth configuration to use the `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` natively.
- Implemented `EmailProvider` for Magic Link authentication to support frictionless Client Portal logins without managing user passwords.
- Added `VerificationToken` to Prisma schema to support secure login verification.

## [0.33.0] - GitHub Sync & Release Checkpoint

- Rebased the local branch on top of the latest GitHub `main` and resolved merge conflicts in auth and environment files.
- Reapplied the Prisma, dashboard, workflow, and auth workspace changes after the upstream merge.
- Verified the repo with `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
- Successfully pushed the merged state back to `origin/main`.

## [0.34.0] - Workspace-Aware RAG Sync Wiring

- Added a shared activity server action that persists CRM activity records and triggers vector sync after each save.
- Added a RAG sync helper with a remote vector endpoint path and a local outbox fallback at `data/rag-outbox.json`.
- Upgraded the chat API to inject workspace-aware CRM context before streaming responses.
- Kept the dashboard contact, lead, and deal activity screens wired to the shared server action for consistent sync behavior.
